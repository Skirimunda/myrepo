# Instructions
R_markdown exercise and modification of the DSAIDE level 2 vignette part.

```{r}
library(DSAIDE)

Ivec = seq(1,101,by=10) #values of recovery rate, g, for which to run the simulation 
peak = rep(0,length(Ivec)) #this will record the peak values for each g
for (n in 1:length(Ivec))
{
  #call the simulator function with different values of g each time
  result <- simulate_introduction(S0 = 500, I0 = Ivec[n], tmax = 200, g = 0.3,  b = 1/2500)
  peak[n] <- max(result$ts[,"I"]) #record max number of infected for each value of g
}
#plot final result
plot(Ivec,peak,type='p',xlab='Initial number of infected',ylab='Max number of infected')

```


In this exercise, I have changed the code such that the for loop is over the initial number of infected (from 1 to 101 in steps of 10) instead of the infection rate g. The resulting plot shows peak infected as a function of initial number of infected.

This work is based on applications and libraries in R program as designed by Andreas and colleagues at the University of Goergia [@Handel2017]
